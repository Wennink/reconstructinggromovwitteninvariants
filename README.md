This program contains an old version of admcycles.
See https://gitlab.com/jo314schmitt/admcycles 

This program does not run on the current version of admcycles because it still uses the 'tautclass' class.

I am currently reaching out to Johannes Schmitt to see if I can incorporate part of my code into the admcycles project.

To install the program place the admcycles and thesiscode folders in the same directory.
Then run sagemath from that directory and type load('thesiscode/init.sage')

There is a list of functions in the file "thesiscommands.sage" that provide the data required in the thesis.

When there are partially symmetric relations, our convention is that the first points are fixed by the symmetry action, while the later points are the 'unsymmetric' ones
